CSS font-size resources:
CSS units for font-size: px | em | rem (https://medium.com/code-better/css-units-for-font-size-px-em-rem-79f7e592bb97)

A third view (https://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/) comes from Chris Coyier of CSS-Tricks. His solution makes use of all three units we encountered so far. He keeps the root size defined in px, modules defined with rem units, and elements inside modules sized with em.
So hereâ€™s my idea: you still keep px size adjustments at the document level so you can make easy/efficient sweeping size changes. But then each module on the page has a font-size set in rem. Actual text elements (h1, h2, p, li, whatever), if you size them at all, are sized in em, and thus become relative to the module.
